*Due to game having different special words each time we will be simulating only one fruit (mango - hint: "Its a tropical yellow fruit.") for our test case. The 2nd generated fruit will be lime - hint: "Green and sour! Superior green skittle flavour." The games mechanics works the same for all other fruit. The underscores are for seperations sake so you can see the change betwen test cases theyre not part of expected output.
